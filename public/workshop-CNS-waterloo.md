Dive into the world of computational narrative systems

Unlike LLMs, story generators ... generate stories ... (CNS)
Computation Narratology
Ceci n'est pas une LLM story pipeline
In this workshop, participants will use their own computers to generate textual stories to grant a hands-on experience.
Independent of participants' programming skills they will find an accessible introduction and potential for advancements since the Narrative Nubs, specifically Story Machine as simplest example so far, offer room for enhancement
offering a sandbox trying, exploring, breaking or extending
participants can present their results and findings through reading to create room for shared analysis and discussion (responsibility, ethical concerns, cultural embedding)

Title: Once Upon a Runtime
Abstract:
This computer science-led, hands-on workshop introduces how stories are generated by computational narrative systems and how they are built.
Participants of diverse academic and practice-based backgrounds can interactively engage with simplified story generators from the Narrative Nubs project, to see how narrative structure emerges from data and algorithms via Python, independent of participants' programming knowledge.
This accessible introduction creates a sandbox for building up, bending, and breaking narrative systems by code, allowing participants to advance the narrative systems themselves and making tangible how small computational choices lead to big storytelling shifts.
The workshop will invite participants to share their generated stories and collectively reflect on applications for the interdisciplinary study of digital narratives and the implications on culture, ethics, and technology of Computational Narratology.
Short Bio:
Jakob Kusnick is a postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Digital Narrative at the University of Bergen, Norway and part of the LEAD AI programme. During his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Southern Denmark, Jakob investigated how Visualization-based Storytelling enhances communication of complex transdisciplinary topics in Digital Humanities and Cultural Heritage. Now he combines the aspects of information visualization and culture with the research on computational generation of stories.

In Canada, the investigation of digital narratives is divided amongst the various disciplinary tools and methodologies in the fields of Cinema and Media Arts, Game Studies, Digital Humanities, E-Literature, and Media Studies. In comparison, our Norwegian counterparts have productively integrated these interdisciplinary approaches under the shared banner of Digital Scholarship/Narratives. The Interdisciplinary Methods for Understanding Digital Narratives (IMUDN) project is invested in producing coordinated, interdisciplinary, and ethically grounded methods for studying digital narratives as they emerge by combining Canadian scholarship with exciting new approaches being developed in Norway. While expertise exists across institutions and disciplines, opportunities for structured, in-person knowledge exchange focused on digital narrative methods remain limited, constraining the timely sharing and uptake of research knowledge within and beyond academia.
The IMUDN project supports SSHRC’s Connection Grant objectives by facilitating a focused international knowledge exchange between early-career scholars at the University of Waterloo (UW) and the University of Bergen’s (UiB) Centre for Digital Narrative. The project aims to (1) connect Canadian and international researchers across disciplines to share and co-create responsible methods for understanding digital narratives; (2) strengthen research networks and mentorship opportunities for postdoctoral scholars; and (3) mobilize knowledge through accessible, open-access outputs tailored to academic, cultural, educational, and policy communities.
